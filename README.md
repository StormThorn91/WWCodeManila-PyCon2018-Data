## Description
This workshop covers an introduction to data analysis using Python. It aims to introduce beginners to concepts, commonly used tools, and workflows to document, describe, analyze, and visualize data. 

Time: 3 hrs  
Format: Follow-along demos & exercises  
Reminders:

1. Bring your own laptop (or share with a friend)
2. [Install needed tools](#tools-and-installation)
3. Download the [materials](#outline-and-materials)
4. Optional: Familiarize your self with [Jupyter Notebook](#launching-the-jupyter-notebook)

## Outline and Materials
The workshop is divided into the following topics. **Please download [these materials](materials) ahead of the workshop.**

* [Introduction](#) and [Documentation with Jupyter notebook](#) (15 mins)
* [Data handling](#) (45 mins)
* [Analysis](#) (45 mins)
* [Visualization](#) (45 mins)
* Today I Learned (15 mins)
* Q&A (15 mins)


## Tools and installation
This will take a bit to download and install so **make sure to set this up before the workshop starts**.

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter notebook
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Seaborn
* Plotly

The easiest way to obtain most of these is to install the [latest version of Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Simply download the corresponding executable for your operating system. For this workshop, we'll be using the Python 3.6.x version. The installer should guide your through the process.

Once you have installed Anaconda, you also need to install the Python library `plotly` for the visualization part.


1. Open `Anaconda Prompt` from the Start menu (Windows) or open the `Terminal` application (Mac/Linux). 
2. Type the following, which should guide you through the installation process.: 

```shell
conda install plotly
```

## Launching the Jupyter Notebook

Most of the materials in this workshop are presented using follow-along Jupyter notebooks. These are interactive notebooks which can contain texts, codes, results of codes, figures, and more. You can read more about Jupyter notebook [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html).

You can also [try Jupyter](https://try.jupyter.org/) without installing. 

However, Anaconda comes with Jupyter notebook! To launch this locally on your computer, simply look for the *Jupyter Notebook* icon in the Start Menu or Desktop (Windows) or type the following in the command prompt or terminal (Windows, Mac, Linux): 

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook will be launched in a new browser window. You can go ahead and explore the dashboard.  More things that you can do is in this [guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html). 

At the start of the workshop, we'll also help you with navigating and using the notebook. But if you want a quick go-over on your own, here's a [great YouTube resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI). Another way to maximize this tool is to familiarize yourselves with [keyboard shortcuts](http://maxmelnick.com/2016/04/19/python-beginner-tips-and-tricks.html). We'll use the basic shortcuts during the workshop, and we'll let you explore more on your own.
